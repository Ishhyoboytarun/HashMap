# HashMap

A hashmap is a data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs and quickly retrieve the value associated with a given key. It does this by using a hash function to map each key to a unique index in an array of "buckets," which each hold a linked list of key-value pairs. When you want to get the value associated with a given key, you can hash the key to find the corresponding bucket and then search through the linked list in that bucket to find the key-value pair you're looking for.

Hashmaps are commonly used in computer science for a variety of applications, including:

Caching: When you need to store the results of expensive computations or database queries, you can use a hashmap to cache the results so that you can retrieve them quickly in the future.
Indexing: When you have a large dataset and need to quickly look up items based on some property (e.g. a user ID), you can use a hashmap to index the dataset by that property.
Counting: When you need to count the frequency of items in a dataset (e.g. counting the number of times each word appears in a book), you can use a hashmap to keep track of the counts.
In practice, the performance of a hashmap depends on the quality of the hash function (which should distribute the keys evenly across the buckets) and the size of the array of buckets (which should be large enough to avoid collisions but not so large that it wastes memory).

Implementations of hashmaps are available in many programming languages, including Go, Python
